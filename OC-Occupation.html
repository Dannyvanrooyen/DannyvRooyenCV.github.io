    <h1>What I want to become</h1>
    <p>
       <div>
         I want to be a programmer. It does not matter what type of programmer, if it is bug fixes or application construction
        I am onboard 100%. I see myself in a small house, with my wife and dog, while I am busy fixing an error that
        has been bugging me for 2 days. I know that I can achieve this.
        </div>
        <div>
            This dream of mine is because I always had the ambition to be a programmer. My mind is always in the same place as coding.
            I always want to do something simplistic to the core because that is how I was taught. I do not see a big difference 
            between me and normal computers. That is why I believe I was made to bea programmer.
