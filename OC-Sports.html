    <h1>Action Crieket</h1>
    <h2>Here is a little clip of my favourite sport.</h2>

    <p>
        This is a video of a bowler in Action crieket. I have chosen this video because this represents
        the person I was in Action crieket. I played for North-West team and was backstop in the 
        year 2015.

    <h1>Rugby</h1>
    <p>
        In my Highschool years I loved to play Rugby, as this was a team sport. In my matrix year I played as the Fly-half as I had a nice kick. It aslo helped me with my leader skills 
        Because it is very important to manage your backline for victory.

    <h1>Esports and gaming</h1>
    <p>
        Here is the achievements that I have on steam using steam API.<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/danmanwtp/gcpd/730/"style="color:Yellow">Claw achievements</a>. This will indeed show how much 
        team based games I play and how long I play them. I believe that this indicates my abilities 
        to play and co-operate with one another. The link will lead you to my cs:go activities.

    <h3>Here is a little video of the game I usually play.</h3>

        I have also partaken in a few E-Sports but I did not win anything. The experience I had in these with my University
        allowing this has made it worth the while.
