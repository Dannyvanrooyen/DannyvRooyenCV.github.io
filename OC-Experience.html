    <h1>CIC Namibia</h1>
    <p>
        I had the oppertunity to work in a very well known IT business. The location of this place is Namibia Windhoek
        and it was the most fun I ever had. The Boss made us complete complex tasks so that we make errors in our code and thus have to spend our nights 
        working through all the bugs. I found this very entertaining. I had learned so much while i was there.
        Working with people became my next favorite thing.

    <h1>PNA Job</h1>
    <p>
        To gain a little bit of money and at the same time sharpen up my people skills, I decided to go and work for PNA. It was a simple shelf packing job. There
        I had a lot of time to work with people putting me under pressure and people just bveing themselves.
        Me and the other workers got along very well. I even made a view good vriends that I go visit from time to time.
