    <h1>Rock climbing</h1>
    <p>
        Believe it or not, but one of my Hobbies are actually not team based. Rock climbing has 
        alwys been so exciting for me. I take it so seriously that I even have a website to show
        me the weather so I could decide if I should climb or not. It is the pollygon weather 
        branch for current weather app.

    <div class="input">
        <input type="text" class="InputV" placeholder="Enter a city">
        <input type="submit" value="Submit" class="button">
    </div>

    <div class="display">
        <h1 class="name"></h1>
        <p class="wind"></p>
        <p class="temp"></p>
    </div>
    <script src="OC-Hobbies.js"></script>
    <p>Using this I can easily see what the wind and temperature will be in my city and if it is optimal for rock climbing.</p>
    
    <h1>Book reading</h1>
    <p>
        One of my hobbies that I had as a small kid was diving nose first into a good book or comic. My reading speed was never below average and
        it helped me through varsity.

    <h1>Adventuring</h1>
    <p>I am a man for adventure. I cannot sit still no matter how what anyone says. I always have that drive to do more and be more.</p>

        if('Notification' in window){
            if(Notification.permission !== "denied"){
                let title = "The title";
                let options = {
                    body:'This is how I use my notification API'
                }
                let notif= new Notification(title,options);

            }else{
                Notification.requestPermission()
                .then(function(result){
                    console.log(result);
                })
                .catch( (err) => {
                    console.log(err);
                });
            }
        }
